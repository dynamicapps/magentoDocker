Need to be running docker first.

Copy or clone your project to src/ folder
Copy a version of app/etc/env.php from one of your environments to src/app/etc/. Update it accordingly to the values from the env/*.env files.
Optional: check that you have all the files required in your project. Our git repo was missing some files in app, app/etc (for example NonComposerComponentRegistration.php, db_schema.xml and others...), so i had to manually copy them to /src folder at this point. This is a repo issue, not something with this docker setup, just if someone happen to have the same issue, something to keep in mind. Also, check all the files in compose.dev.yaml which are mounted exist in your project, otherwise you will get an error when trying to start the containers.
bin/start --no-dev
bin/copytocontainer --all
At this step, ignore warnings about are some folders missing. When you run bin/copytocontainer --all, it runs bin/fixperms as well. If you check the content of the fixperms, it does this:
bin/clinotty find var vendor pub/static pub/media app/etc ( -type f -or -type d ) -exec chmod u+w {} +;
But, at this point, we do not have these folders in our container yet. I think this script could be optimized, to check first if these folders exists or not.
bin/setup-composer-auth
bin/clinotty composer config --no-plugins allow-plugins.magento/magento-composer-installer true
bin/clinotty composer config --no-plugins allow-plugins.magento/inventory-composer-installer true
bin/clinotty composer config --no-plugins allow-plugins.laminas/laminas-dependency-plugin true
bin/composer install
If vendor folder is not present yet, because we have cloned it from git, run the above command to install all the packages.
bin/fixowns && bin/fixperms
bin/mysql < your-db-dumb.sql
Import your database and set up any local config values which are specific to your local environment.
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/clinotty bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f -j 4
bin/clinotty bin/magento indexer:reindex
bin/setup-domain dish-dev.local
bin/fixowns && bin/fixperms (idk if this one is required here, i just added it to be sure
bin/clinotty bin/magento cache:flush
bin/clinotty bin/magento cron:install
bin/clinotty bin/magento deploy:mode:set developer (probably can skip if you have developer mode in your env.php file already).

For Magento 2.4.2 I needed to edit compose.yaml
PHPFPM: markoshust/magento-php:7.4-fpm
DB: mariadb:10.4
ElasticSearch: markoshust/magento-elasticsearch:7.9.3-1
Redis: redis:6.0-alpine

Here's what I actually did from WSL:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markshust/docker-magento/master/lib/template | bash
bin/start --no-dev
bin/copytocontainer --all
bin/clinotty composer config --no-plugins allow-plugins.magento/magento-composer-installer true
bin/clinotty composer config --no-plugins allow-plugins.magento/inventory-composer-installer true
bin/clinotty composer config --no-plugins allow-plugins.laminas/laminas-dependency-plugin true
bin/composer install
bin/fixowns && bin/fixperms
bin/mysql -uroot -pmagento < r7myamqizbogq--staging-5em2ouy--r7myamqizbogq_stg--dump.sql
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/clinotty bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f -j 4
bin/clinotty bin/magento indexer:reindex
bin/setup-domain magento2.test
bin/fixowns && bin/fixperms
bin/clinotty bin/magento cache:flush
bin/clinotty bin/magento cron:install
bin/clinotty bin/magento deploy:mode:set developer
